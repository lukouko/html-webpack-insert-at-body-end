# HTML Webpack Insert at Body End Plugin

When using the [HtmlWebpackPlugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin), it may be necessary to ensure that a script tag is inserted at the end of the HTML body.
If `inject: body` is used for injecting chunks, it is impossible to ensure insertion of a non chunk script tag after the chunks.

This webpack plugin captures the HTML produced by HtmlWebpackPlugin and allows for the insertion of a script tag at the end of a body.

Installation
------------
Install the plugin with npm:
```shell
$ npm install html-webpack-insert-at-body-end --save-dev
```
Basic Usage
------------
The plugin will take the HTML5 file generated by the HtmlWebpackPlugin and append a script tag to the body. Just add the plugin to your webpack config as follows:

```javascript
var HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
var HtmlWebpackInsertAtBodyEndPlugin = require('html-webpack-insert-at-body-end');

var webpackConfig = {
  entry: 'index.js',
  output: {
    path: 'dist',
    filename: 'index_bundle.js'
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({filename: 'index.html'}),
    new HtmlWebpackInsertAtBodyEndPlugin({filename: 'index.html', scriptTag: 'scripts/patch.js'})
  ]
};
```
